# CSC 445/545 - Summer 2021 - Programming Project 

The files in the `input` directory contain representations of various linear
programs in standard form (using the input format defined in the programming 
project specification).

The LPs prefixed by `vanderbei_` were transcribed from "Linear Programming: 
Foundations and Extensions" by Robert J. Vanderbei (5th ed.).

The LPs prefixed by `netlib_` were converted from the netlib benchmark for 
LP solvers (see https://www.netlib.org/lp/index.html). The LPs themselves 
were modified slightly from the originals during conversion (since the 
format used by the netlib project does not store the LPs in standard form,
and since the netlib LPs were generally stated as minimization problems).
However, the adapted LPs should be faithful to the original netlib ones,
although the optimal value of the adapted LPs might be the negation of the
optimal value of the original LPs (due to the conversion of minimization
to maximization).
